## How to teleop?
- ```roslaunch ck9_base minimal.launch```
- ```roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch```

That's it play around with your CK-9 and move it around with your PC keyboard!

## How to create a map/run SLAM?
- ```roslaunch ck9_base minimal.launch```
- ```roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch```
- ```roslaunch ck9_navigation slam.launch```
- ```roscd ck9/rviz``` and then ```rviz -d slam.rviz```
- View the bot and the map being created in rviz, and move around the bot with teleop to build a full map
- To save the map: ```rosrun map_server map_saver -f map_name``` with terminal at the location where you want to save the map
- You now have a map ready to run your bot autonomously on!

## How to run autonomous navigation?
- ```roslaunch ck9_base minimal.launch```
- ```roslaunch ck9_navigation navigate.launch map_file:=/home/username/path_to_map.yaml``` 
- ```roscd ck9_base/rviz``` and then ```rviz -d navigate.rviz```
- Use the "2D Nav Goal" button in rviz to publish your navigation goals and see your CK-9 in action!
